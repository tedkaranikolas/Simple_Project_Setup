# Simple_Project_Setup

###Description

Creating base projects is something that will serve you well. With what you know now, we are going to create a build that encompasses the basics.

“Simple Project Setup” is a name that would work well in this case.

Here are the steps that need to be completed in the allotted time:

Create a project for this in your gitHub (Simple Project Setup)

Create a new project folder on your machine

Initialize Git in this folder

Create an index.html in this folder and populate it with the following: head with title of YOUR NAME Simple Project Setup body with: H2 element with same text as the page title Button element with text of your choosing

Create a scripts folder and a myJavascript.js within this folder

Source this file into your html file

Create a function named as you choose within the js file that console logs out button clicked

Add an onclick attribute to the button that runs the function

Push to your github and submit to http://primeacademy.io/student/

P.S. feel free to add some interesting functionality to your function for some bonus points.
